# weather-app
A weather forecast web app using JS. You have to wait few seconds to load the background images :-(
## Feature of the projects 
1. Geolocation-based Weather:
   Add a feature to automatically detect the user's location using their device's geolocation capabilities. Upon page load or a specific user action, fetch weather data for the detected location and display it to the user.
2 . Dynamic Backgrounds Based on Weather:
   Change the background image and overlay opacity based on the weather condition of the searched city. For example, set a sunny background for clear skies, a rainy background for rain, or a snowy background for snow. This can enhance the visual representation of the weather.
3. Multi-language Support:
  Implement a feature that allows users to select their preferred language for the UI. Provide language options in a dropdown menu or through dedicated buttons. Translate the UI elements and weather information accordingly based on the user's selection.

These features will improve the user experience and functionality of the weather app.
